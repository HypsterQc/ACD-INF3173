# INF3173 // Operating Systems Principles

In the INF3173 course, I learn the fundamental principles of operating systems, focusing on process management, memory, and file handling. I explore concepts such as threads, concurrency, inter-process communication, and security. The course emphasizes system programming in C under Unix/Linux, with practical assignments to apply these concepts in real-world environments.
